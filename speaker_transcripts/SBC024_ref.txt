Speaker 2: Oh. Now what. Backgammon? What's Hearts.
Speaker 1: Hearts. It's the card game.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah? Put it up there.
Speaker 1: Wanna play hearts?
Speaker 2: Let's check that one out. wait, play. I've never played hearts before,
Speaker 1: You've never played Hearts?
Speaker 2: in my life. No, I don't know how to play it.
Speaker 1: Oh. Okay. I'll teach you.
Speaker 2: Passing disabled.
Speaker 1: Queen of That's you. 0. 000000irst lead rotates. First, yeah. Always pass left. Alright. So this is us.
Speaker 2: Groucho, Harpo,
Speaker 1: The object, okay, every heart, okay, every heart is one point,
Speaker 2: Is
Speaker 1: the queen of spades is thirteen points, the object is not to have any points. And, you play following suit, and, you can take, if you take tricks, the highest card of the suit, takes the trick. If you don't have the card of the suit, you throw whatever you want.
Speaker 2: Okay. So hearts, and the queen of spades,
Speaker 1: Are bad.
Speaker 2: are the only thing.
Speaker 1: That are
Speaker 2: That
Speaker 1: That are points. that have points. Right. So if
Speaker 2: So,
Speaker 1: if you throw
Speaker 2: Look okay. so we got like three points, right here. Right.
Speaker 1: we have three points in our hand, exactly.
Speaker 2: And we wanna try to get rid of that.
Speaker 1: N_Right, but we're passing. Now the first thing you do is you pass three cards to your left. Now these are low hearts. So I can I'm not gonna pass those. I'm gonna pass, the four of clubs,
Speaker 2: All the Why is that.
Speaker 1: And these are two high why just because. And cause you should always pass a club, so that the person so that the first hand, everyone has a club, so that they can't discard a heart. Cause you always assume that everyone's no one is void, of a suit. The first time around, so you don't have to worry about throwing a high card.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then I'm gonna throw two high cards, so I don't take those tricks. Because
Speaker 2: But what difference does it make if you take a trick.
Speaker 1: Well because
Speaker 2: They're not worth anything.
Speaker 1: Cause if I If I take a the diamond trick, and somebody didn't have diamonds, and they threw a heart into that pile, I was gonna take that, with that ace. So if I throw an ace of diamonds, and somebody doesn't have any diamonds, they're gonna throw a heart on me, and I'm gonna have to take that trick.
Speaker 2: Okay, but, but if they play hearts, that doesn't that doesn't win anything.
Speaker 1: If they play
Speaker 2: n_okay. Just go ahead and play.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright? So I'm passing three s_three cards.
Speaker 2: And I got,
Speaker 1: the seven of hearts, three of hearts, and the king of spades. Begin play. The two of clubs always leads, I'm gonna throw the ace of clubs, assuming I'm gonna take this trick,
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: no one
Speaker 2: and and everybody
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it's kinda risky playing the king, since,
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna assume everyone has clubs still.
Speaker 2: Okay. Alright.
Speaker 1: Okay, cause there are thirteen cards, I'm assuming it's an equal deal. Now there are eight clubs out, that means there are only four more left.
Speaker 2: So you don't so you wanna play,
Speaker 1: So I'm
Speaker 2: A high high diamond.
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly. Like a high diamond. So jack of diamonds. Okay, taken with
Speaker 2: Okay, so he took that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: so now Now the spade,
Speaker 1: Now this is a tricky one, now, If I have a high spade now, I'd throw it, because I could take this trick, and the my highest spade would be out. Now I don't ever wanna take the queen of spades, high spades are dangerous because you might queen of spades is a hard card to get rid of.
Speaker 2: So if, yeah okay, I see.
Speaker 1: Now I don't oh I do have a spade.
Speaker 2: Well you're in a good position now, because you've seen what everybody else has played.
Speaker 1: Right. That's why. Diamond,
Speaker 2: So you have to play a diamond.
Speaker 1: Now
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: Right, and there have been no Has there been a diamond trick? There's been one diamond trick.
Speaker 2: uh, yeah.
Speaker 1: only one though.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you played your ace.
Speaker 1: Okay now it was led, the spade was led, but there's a heart in this trick. So I wanna get under the seven. Because I don't wanna take this trick. Because there's a heart.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But that's easy, 2cause I only have two spades, and they're both under seven.
Speaker 2: so you would have taken that,
Speaker 1: If I had a eight.
Speaker 2: So now, you can still get under that,
Speaker 1: I could still get under so,
Speaker 2: too. He's got an eight. Alright. So
Speaker 1: Now listen, Okay now, two different people took hearts. Now, if you have all if you take all the points, if you take all the points. All thirteen hearts, and the queen of diamonds,
Speaker 2: So that's twentysix points.
Speaker 1: it's called, right. It's called shooting the moon, and you get you give everyone else twentysix points, or else you're minus twentysix points. And that's good. Shooting the moon is really hard to do. Now look it, I don't have a club,
Speaker 2: So you can throw a heart.
Speaker 1: there you go.
Speaker 2: A high heart. Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't have a club. Now, somebody else did take hearts. Right? Or did he or am I mistaken. I thought someone else did take hearts, I think somebody else did take hearts.
Speaker 2: Queen of spades gonna have to come up n,
Speaker 1: There. He led,
Speaker 2: there it is. 0id he just shoot the moon? I thought someone else took No. Yeah. So he got Groucho got one heart, One,
Speaker 1: and Chico got twentyfive.
Speaker 2: So he's kinda bumming right now.
Speaker 1: So he sucks. right.
Speaker 2: Okay. So pass three cards. So we wanna pass,
Speaker 1: Alright. Pass, so we're gonna pass, the king of spades.
Speaker 2: King of puppydogs' feet. How come you don't pass the king of clubs.
Speaker 1: I might. I don't have any aces here. I'm gonna pass a low heart. Just so they can't shoot the moon. I got the ace of hearts, Okay. Two of clubs. King of clubs. Ace is out. So my queen is the highest there. Alright, my jack is the highest there.
Speaker 2: So you wanna play that now. Oh,
Speaker 1: Well I'll do it. Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you took that one. But that doesn't make any difference.
Speaker 1: Right. Now the two See, alright. Now. Diamonds are wasted. Alright.
Speaker 2: Did you just take that?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That heart? No?
Speaker 1: No. Groucho has the uh,
Speaker 2: Spades were led.
Speaker 1: The f
Speaker 2: So you play,
Speaker 1: Spade was led, The ace.
Speaker 2: Can you play a club, if spades were led, and you didn't have,
Speaker 1: I can Yeah, I can
Speaker 2: But, but if you had hearts?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I can lead
Speaker 2: So you can play anything then. I can I can play anything. So why don't you just get rid of high clubs.
Speaker 1: Right. I'm who's Harpo's gonna take this, so the points are split now. So I don't have to worry. Now the queen is the highest, so, Two the two of hearts is a great lead. You can't lead hearts, unless hearts have already been dropped, also.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh shit. I took a point there. I'm gonna take all the rest, I think. Um,
Speaker 2: How can you.
Speaker 1: Maybe not. WH Oh man. I knew it WH. I'm gonna take all the rest. I just got like seven points. shit. Eight. Alright, I have no spades. This is a really good hand. I have no spades whatsoever. It's really good.
Speaker 2: Play hearts. I'm gonna try to shoot the moon.
