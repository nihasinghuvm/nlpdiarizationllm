      "hyp_text": "I got a story to tell you. It's a Shaggy Dog story as long as we're talking about that record at $600. I'll tell you the story. Oh gosh, Ray and I and Sue and Buddy took a trip to Mexico City. It must have been four or six months after my dad died. That's how I remember it. He died in December of 67. Sometime in 68, we took this trip. We've been talking about it for a while. Flew down to Mexico City. We, I think it was the name of my hotel, which wouldn't mean anything now, but we ended up in a fabulous hotel. First night, very unhappy with our rooms. We're getting down now. And the next morning, Buddy, who's an early riser, anyhow, he was probably up at four o'clock, and he went down there and complained to the manager. So, because it was not the accommodation we were supposed to have had, we checked in at eight o'clock at night or so, which is, in Mexico, it was like, you know. Well, we ended up with a corner suite with, it was so big, we could have a party for 50 people and invested three bathrooms in it. Two bedrooms, so they had, but they had an extra guest bathroom with a big bar. It was open on two sides, because we didn't have everybody there for two hours. And I remember the New York Yankees were training there, so it probably was season opens in April, so it probably was February or March. Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford and all of them. I wish I had been smart enough to know them. These baseball cards and autographs would be selling for three or four hundred dollars, but at any rate, I went down there with a recorder. We used to, we had those things at the store that we used to use when we go out of town, particularly if we were looking at some site, or we were looking at the store with some comments and talking to those things. We had four or five of them here and had one, I had one, I had one. Everything worked, probably a financial guy. Things sold at the time for about $8,900. eight or nine hundred dollars. You've got a very sophisticated little one now about this size. A little sumbitch weighed about fifteen pounds. It was some heavy sumbitch. Had a pouch, something like you, and I carried it around. At any rate, my wife had fallen in love with a Mexican artist by the name of Nearman. I forgot his first name. A Jewish guy. his painting sold for generally a thousand dollars plus which was for me a lot of money in the lab years ago i was no way i was gonna spend first of all didn't like it the first plan relative in Mexico or something, but they've been down there many times. And he had his book. And we got down there and he was all over the place. His paintings where he lived in Mexico City. And we had a cab driver that was going to take us I can't remember one of the roughest rides. And if you ever been to Mexico City and did a ride in some kind of city about 100 miles away, I thought we were going to die going down to an old car. Anyway. But before that, he took us around the city. Still got his car in somewhere. Slammed the damn door on his guy, poor guy's hand one day. Now we had him about three days. One day we took him down to wherever we went. Buddy and Sue didn't go. But he took us to the ruins and a lot of stuff. I knew then and I know now that those guys take you to a particular place, they get a commission. Well, they took us to this guy's studio. They took us to this artist's studio. And Ray, he was there. And she saw a painting she liked. He wanted that damn recorder. And he said, I'll tell you what I'll do. He said, if you take this painting, I want that recorder. I'll take it. He said, no, I can't do this. It was about a $1,000 swap. Shit, I thought my wife was going to have it. She was pissed off. Mexico City was a, in those days, probably still is. For this guy, he was very successful. But it was an art company and there were a lot of Americans down there. He was not an American. There were a lot of Americans down there because cost of living was so cheap at the time. At least art shows everywhere. Well, we bought a painting with a little Mexican woman, still got it with a watermelon on her head, liked it a lot, and paid $30 for it. That's about my price range. They bought a couple of other inexpensive paintings, made them collectively. They spent $150. We weren't art collectors. And to spend $1,000 to me for a painting was unthinkable. It was the first painting ever bought. My father-in-law bought a Jerry Ray. It was one of Jerry's original early paintings, which I thoroughly enjoyed. She used to change styles. But while we were down there, And I've seen that somewhere before. You know, I've had that painting for thirty-five years, I guess. I've never framed it, and I really like it. My father-in-law wanted to give me a painting from a piece of art from my office, and so we had a display guy at the time, but it was Ben Money, fashioned himself as an artist. So he got this from Jerry, and I loved it. And I can see all kinds of things. This fellow Leroy Neiman over here, sports artist. Not the same guy as this guy, Neiman. I forgot his name. SHORT? I thought there was a connection. Well, we looked at a lot of art in the parks, and it was pleasant weathering. It was sort of like what's it called, a district in New York, where on Sunday you put all the artists, put their paintings out, the village, the village. You know, all these artists put their, well they had, must have had three areas like that. There must have been thousands of paintings. And most of them very inexpensive, starving artists that were down there. Lots of them there. Well, we wandered around down in the area which I've forgotten the area that they called in Mexico City where most of the jewelry shops are and things. It's got a name. I can't remember. I haven't ever been back. They also had a lot of artist galleries down there. And I walked in this gallery, there were one of them. We were down there maybe 10 days. And I saw this guy, near when I never heard of him. At that time, he got famous at the 19, probably 72 Olympics. But his art was already in collections of guys like Edward G. Robinson. He was very popular in Hollywood. He also had a very prolific big handlebar mustache. And I walked in, and there must have been about 12 or 15 paintings in there. They were... SHORT? You walked into a studio or... He didn't live there. He didn't live in Mexico. The guy, the Jewish fellow, they're both Jewish. This guy Nierman, who was a Mexican national, lived there. Forgot his first name. Leonardo Nierman or something. At any rate, this guy's name was Leroy Nierman. I never heard of Nierman, because Ray went down there and wanted to buy one of those paintings. These were paintings, which you have to say, were about the size of this Joe Namath there, which is a seriograph. And we went in, They were just back from Acapulco. The season was just over in Acapulco. And he had about 15, 20 paintings, 25 paintings. Football players, horse races, that's what he did. They were about that size. I'd been in there. I looked at them. They just struck me as something I loved. They were great. They had a very distinctive style. And the guy said, Had you been in here so many times, what time did they give you a deal? You can pick out any 40s you want or give them to you for $500. Shit, I love those things. I stewed on those son of bitches. I bought those fucking paintings. I'd have to buy that damn thing for Ray. I'd trade that camera for $1,000 and $900 to buy another one. I promise you this guy is my witness. this guy's original self for $100,000 a piece or more. He is big, big, he's the premier sports artist in the world. And I'd never heard of him. But of course, Price was right for me, but I didn't buy him. That was about 1968, and I was watching the Olympics of 1972, and he'd been engaged by the Olympic Committee. He was prominent to him, but not world famous. And he was up all over. He's got a great big Bull Moose mustache, sort of a big General Bull Moose, if you remember. And his aunt was so distinctive. And he's just sketching. I said, Jesus, that's my man. I remember semi-philippics. I hollered and screamed and told the story. Well, of course, since that time, I wanted mainly one main gallery in New York that I think distributes from around the United States, and I'm on the mailing list. And they get today 2,500 to 2,750 for a serigraph. I could have walked away with those things, but that's my story on that machine, that damn thing. And, of course, obviously I didn't know what I was missing if I'd done that. But, you know. You didn't spend that much on the whole trip probably. Oh, hell, you know, I would say probably, certainly we didn't spend $500 for novelties and things of that nature. You know, you talk about a long time ago, Mexico City was cheap. We were priced. I mean, we stayed in a first-rate, I guess it's called today, a four-star hotel, but hell, I don't mind. We paid $20, $25 a night, you know. But anyhow, I give my wife this story every once in a while, this guy's name, because I like this guy, I love him. And of course, you know, I've never, this one over here on the right, although it's signed by Paul Brian, And it was also signed by the artist. It was done for a poster. That's not what they call a serigraph. Joe Namath, who was of course an Alabama football player, yes, I saw it out in San Francisco and my in-laws bought that for me. That's my experience with one of those machines. I didn't have enough judgment to give him the machine because I'd say probably it wasn't like it was like computers in the year or so after that. That thing was so impractical because it was heavy, heavy, heavy. Well, it's like you say, you gave me one for Christmas today. You know, you buy one for $60, $80. I got one. I bought Radio Shack. Did Ray ever get the Nearman? No. But over the years, I'll have to tell her this story tonight because I haven't thought about it in a long time. And she'll say to me, I told you to kill him. I told you. I must have gone to a new place five times. You know, they'd go in there and your mouth would just war it. Shit. I bought her. But you knew you were going to have to buy her. Well, if I bought those things, shit, I'd have to buy her that damn thing. Oh, ain't no question. There was no question about that. Wouldn't have been any living with her, you know. I've gotten a lot better, but in those days, you know, hell, I was maybe, let's just see, 68, 78, 88. Just 27, 28 years ago, I was 38, 39 years old, and I sure wasn't prosperous. I had my damn trip budgeted. And to have gone out there and spent, I remember, $1,500 to $2,000 for artwork, you know, my mother, who was, you know, stronger and looser than me, come back because she'd known. I mean, my fucking head now. She'd have deducted it. Oh. At any rate. That's a good story, though. True story. Good story. True story. It was a true story. Well, it would have cost you that to replace the doggone machine. I'd had to replace it for the store, but as it was only a matter of, I guess, a year, those things were really antiquated. Although, we used them a lot in those days. And I recorded the whole trip and, you know, things that we did. It was a wonderful trip. Better than keeping a diary. Well, it was a lot easier. It really is. Well, we tried keeping a diary on the China trip and, man, it was... Well, I keep a diary because I've been traveling much lately. I keep a diary when I go out of the country. Still got it in here. Otherwise, my problem is, and it's a lot easier to do it that way, but I keep a diary when I go out of the country. I forgot where I went. I have to look because I can't remember. Well, you go to so many places, on a cruise particularly, you know, so many places in a short time that you get them mixed up. Now, we can't even keep our photos straight without the diary. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, when you get back from your trip until you make another trip. But having taken as many trips as you've taken, shit, they sort of run together. I'm talking about the ones that were five years ago to separate the trip that you went on this one from. It's tough to do, but it's a lot easier to die than you can transcribe it. But I don't take my diary in the domestic United States, and we haven't traveled all that much, but I have taken the first trip I made. In 1976, outside of Mexico, out of the country, I went to the Orient on a business trip. But it was, I went to Japan with Osaka, which was the Texas city, and then Taipei and Hong Kong. And it was a U-Bent. But it was, for me, not only in education, we'd been doing some importing, but through a group. And it was a group that went. I guess it probably was a dozen in our group that went. It was a group of stores we were associated with. It was an interesting trip, very educational. I still got my notes from 1976, but those goddamn cards and how they get over everybody gives you cards. I have to get how impressed I was with all the Orientals. The Japanese are so bright, my God. I just... They work at it though, man. They're the Chinese work at it. They're good students. Listen, look at these people from India, what good students they are. Some of you fine doctors here. Thirty-three percent of the black juveniles in their 20s are either in jail, on parole, or just released. Thirty-three percent. And I read in another one... SHORT? That doesn't count. I mean it got worse. And I believe I'm correct on this for you. 12% of the black male population of the United States is in prison. 12% of the black male population, as you say. How many ought to be in jail? Probably that many more. But the point I was going to make is there are always exceptions. And not to take anything away from Percy Jones' article I read this morning. I don't know what his family had, but he's come out of it. But by and large, across the board, they've just never educated themselves. They come from his background. That's the hard part. They haven't educated me. You see these people come here from Taiwan, Korea, Cambodia, Taipei. Parents can't speak English. They come over and they're not speaking English. And they excel holistically in the most difficult subjects, I mean chemistry, physics, medicine. I remember one year, at the time I remember reading the articles, but ten or twelve years ago, there were fourteen public and private high schools and three or four fellows, I don't know how many of them were there. I remember there was a big article, it was five valedictorians. This is a street proposal, five valedictorians that year were Oriental descent. It couldn't have been at that time, 250 families in the whole damn area. You think about the Jews, the Irish, and the blacks, and it's the same all over the fucking world. And I just read an article in the New York Times yesterday, a clip from my wife to read, about the fact that in Israel, where they have brought in 30,000 and 500,000 Russians. They're proud of the fact that they've been able to do this in a country of five million people. would devastate most countries. I mean they... It's 10%. And the Ethiopians in particular had a big march last week because they're second-class citizens. The Jews look down on them too. You know, they've got a class situation. They look different. And because they haven't accepted the Russians too well either. Although the Russians, a high percentage of Russians are, according to this article, are scientists, doctors, But there's a big, you know, there's a class differential, which was interesting. I really hadn't thought about it in many years how those blacks had integrated into society. I am told, I haven't seen any of them, but the blacks, they're not like the Alpenacs. They're smaller features, but they are dark skinned, and they looked at them. I don't know if there are any other black Jews over there. I don't know. A lot from South Africa, but they're well-educated people around there, a lot of them. A lot of Jews from South Africa. Oh, yeah. I know that this fellow, Goldstone, who was the head of this group. It was a Jewish fellow because there was a picture of him in the paper with a yamaki on it. He had looked pretty good indication. Well, you know, there's what astounds me is, and this goes back into 19, let's see, Duner, This goes back maybe 1970 in Houston.",

That\u00ef\u00bds how I remember it, he died in sixtys Oh God. December sixtyseven, so, sometime in sixtyeight we took this trip, we\u00ef\u00bdd been talking about it for a while, uh, flew down to Mexico City, uh we, think of the name of my hotel, which wouldn\u00ef\u00bdt mean anything now, but we ended up in a fabulous hotel, uh, first night, we were with our rooms, we got down there, and the next morning, Buddy, who\u00ef\u00bds a early riser anyhow, was probably up four o'clock, and he went down there complaining to the manager, So, cause it was not the accommodation we were supposed to have had, we checked in about eight o\u00ef\u00bdclock at night or so, which is, in Mexico is like, you know, Well we ended up with a corner suite. With, It was so big, we could've had a party for fifty people XXXX. Three bathrooms in it, two bedrooms, so they had, but they had an extra guest bathroom, big bar, it was circ, open on two sides, of course we didn\u00ef\u00bdt have anybody there but the two of us, And I remember the New York Yankees were training there. So it probably was, the season opens in April, so it probably was February or March, Mickey Mantle, and uh Whitey Ford and all of em, I wish I'd been smart enough to know then that uh, these baseball cards, and those autographs, would be selling for, three or four hundred dollars, but, at any rate, uh, I went down there with a recorder. We used to We had those things at the store, that we used to use, when we\u00ef\u00bdd go out of town and, particularly if we were looking at some site, or, we were looking at a store, when we had some comments, we'd talk into those things. We had four or five of em, Aaron had one, I had one, Mike had one, had one, Things sold at the time for about eight or ninehundred dollars. Eight or ninehundred? Eight or ninehundred dollars. Uh, you got a very sophisticated one, but you know the little ones now about this size. Well this son of a bitch weighed about. It was. Had a pouch, like, sorta like you\u00ef\u00bdve got. I carried it around. Well any rate, my wife had fallen in love, with a, Mexican artist by the name of Nierman. Forgot his first name. Jewish guy. Mm. Mexican national. His paintings sold, for generally, a thousand dollars plus. Which was, for me, A lotta money in those days. Twentyfive years ago, I was no way I was gonna spend a First of all I didn\u00ef\u00bdt like him. Very splashy. Albert and Marcia had one of his paintings, they had They had I I don\u00ef\u00bdt know, Marcia had a relative in Mexico, or something. But they\u00ef\u00bdd been down there. Many times and, and they had his book, and, we got down there, and he was, uh, all over the place. His paintings were, he lived in Mexico City. And uh, we had a cab driver. Uh, that was gonna take us to, wherever the place where the gold was. I can\u00ef\u00bdt remember, one of the roughest rides, and if you ever been to Mexico City, you made that ride, some kinda city, about hundred miles away, I thought we were gonna die going down there. An old car and, anyway. Well before that, he took us around the city, still got his card somewhere. Slammed the damn door on this guy, poor guy\u00ef\u00bds hand one day, inadvertently, we were getting out, we had him about three days, one day we took him down to wherever we went, Buddy and Sue didn\u00ef\u00bdt go, but he took us to the ruins, and all that stuff. You know, uh, you know, I and I I knew then, and I know now, that those guys, take you to a particular place, they get a commission. Well, they took us to this guy\u00ef\u00bds studio. He what? Took us to this artist\u00ef\u00bds studio. Uh, and uh, Rae, he was there. And she saw a painting she liked. And, uh, he wanted that damn recorder. And he said I tell you what I\u00ef\u00bdll do. make you a deal. He said I'll You take this painting, I want that recorder. I\u00ef\u00bdll take it. naw I can\u00ef\u00bdt do that, it\u00ef\u00bds not mine. It was It\u00ef\u00bds about a thousand dollar swap. Shit I thought my wife was gonna have a fit, she was pissed off, Mexico City was a, uh in those days, probably still is, not For this guy he was very successful. Uh, very prolific. But it was an art colony, and there were a lot of Americans down there. He was not an American. A lot of Americans down there, uh because, cost of living was so cheap at the time. And they had these art shows everywhere. Well we bought a painting, uh, of a little Mexican woman, still got it, with a watermelon on her head, like it a lot. Think I paid. Well that was about my price range. Uh, while I was down there, we may have bought a couple of other inexpensive paintings, maybe collectively we bought, maybe spent a hundred and fifty dollars. Uh, hell I was not an art We weren\u00ef\u00bdt art collectors. And uh, to spend a thousand dollars, to me for a painting, was unthinkable. Uh, The first painting I ever bought, my fatherinlaw bought it from Geri f, Geri Rae, it was one of Geri\u00ef\u00bds original early early paintings, which I thoroughly enjoy, she\u00ef\u00bds changed styles but, While we were down there, uh, You know I, This It I\u00ef\u00bdve seen that somewhere before. You know I\u00ef\u00bdve had that painting for thirtyfive years I guess. I\u00ef\u00bdve never framed it. And I really like it. Uh, my My my fatherinlaw wanted to give me a painting for my Piece of art for my office. And so I had a We had a display guy at the time, by the name of Ben Money, fashioned himself as an artist. And I said Ben, pick me out something. fifty bucks to spend. So, he got this from Geri, and I loved it. It\u00ef\u00bds beautiful. And and, I can see all kinda things in it, It\u00ef\u00bds got a lotta color and, Lotta color. I see a Chinese junk, At any rate, to make a long This fellow LeRoy Neiman, Sports artist. Not the same guy, as this guy Nierman. I\u00ef\u00bdve forgotten his name. Oh I thought there was a connection. No. No connection. there is a connection on the story, Well, we looked at a lot of art, in in in the, in the, uh parks, and there at least it was, pleasant weather and, Like that uh, It was sorta like, uh, What the hell they call the district in New York, where on Sunday, they put all the artists, put their paintings out, uh, the Village, the Village. The Village. You know all the all these artists put their Well they had, must've had three areas like that. and my god, there must've been of paintings. And uh, most of em, very inexpensive. Uh starving artists that were down there, American. Well, uh, we wandered around down in the, the area which, I\u00ef\u00bdve forgotten the area that they called, in Mexico City where, uh, most of the jewelry shops are and things. It\u00ef\u00bds got a name. I can\u00ef\u00bdt remember, I\u00ef\u00bdve never been back. They also had a lot of, uh, artist galleries down there. And I walked into this gallery, during one of our We were down there maybe ten days. And I saw this guy Nierman. I never heard of him, at that time. He he he got famous at the nineteen, uh, probably seventytwo Olympics. Uh, but his His art was already in collections of guys like Edward gee Robinson, it was very popular in Hollywood. He also was very prolific. Big handlebar mustache. And I walked in, and there must have been about, twelve or fifteen paintings in there. They were, uh, You walked into his studio, or, It was a gallery. Uh, he didn\u00ef\u00bdt live there. he didn\u00ef\u00bdt live in Mexico. Okay. The The guy the Jewish fellow, they\u00ef\u00bdre both Jewish. Okay. this guy Nierman, who was a Mexican national, lived there. Okay. Forgotten his first name. Leonardo Nierman or something. But any rate, but uh, this guy\u00ef\u00bds name was LeRoy Neiman, I\u00ef\u00bdd never heard of him, well I'd heard of Nierman. Uh, because Rae went down there wanting to buy one of those paintings. These were paintings, which I\u00ef\u00bdd say were about the size of this Joe Namath. there. Which is a seriograph. And, we went in, and uh, they were just back from Acapulco, season was just over in Acapulco. And he had about fifteen twenty paintings, twentyfive paintings, football players, horse races, that\u00ef\u00bds what he did, they were about that size. I\u00ef\u00bdd been in there, oh God I looked at em, they just struck me as something, I loved em. They were great. They were you know very Had a very distinctive style. And, uh, the guy said uh, God you've been in here, so many times that, said I'll make you a deal. You pick out any four of these you want, I\u00ef\u00bdll give em to you for fivehundred dollars. The four of em. Shit, I loved those things. I stewed on those son of bitches, stewed on those son of bitches, I figured, I bought those fucking paintings, I\u00ef\u00bdd have to buy that damn thing for Rae, or, I\u00ef\u00bdd trade that camera for a thousand dollars, and ninehundred dollars to buy another one, I promise you as God is my witness. This guy\u00ef\u00bds originals sell for. You are kidding. They were. He is, big, big, He\u00ef\u00bds the. Really. And uh, I\u00ef\u00bdd never heard of him. And, but of course the price was right for me, but I didn\u00ef\u00bdt buy em. That was That was about nineteen Spring of sixtyeight. And I was watching the Olympics, of nineteenseventytwo. And he\u00ef\u00bdd been engaged by the Olympic committee. Uh he was prominent then, but not world famous. And uh, I He was up all over. He\u00ef\u00bds got a great big bull of Bull Moose moustache sort of a deal, General Bull Moose if you remember. Yep. And uh, his art was so distinctive. And he\u00ef\u00bds The sketching. I said Jesus. That\u00ef\u00bds my man. I remember seeing at the Olympics. I hollered and screamed, and I told the story, Well of course, since that time, I'm on his mailing list, one main gallery in New York, that uh, think distributes for him around the United States, and I\u00ef\u00bdm on the mailing list, and they get today, twentyfive hundred to twentysevenfifty for a seriograph. Of which he produces maybe three to fivehundred of em. Depending on the issue. But these were originals. Jon I promise you as God as my witness. I He was I could've walked away with those things and And uh, I I I But that\u00ef\u00bds my story on that machine. That damn thing, and of course, I didn\u00ef\u00bdt know, Obviously I didn\u00ef\u00bdt know what I was missing, if I\u00ef\u00bdd. Obviously. But you know, But still fivehundred dollars was a lot of money in Fivehundred dollars was You didn\u00ef\u00bdt spend that much on the whole trip probably. Oh hell I I, you know I I, I would I would say probably, certainly we didn\u00ef\u00bdt spend fivehundred dollars for, uh, for, novelties and things of that nature, you know it was You you talking about a long time ago. Mexico City was cheap. Jesus Christ, Oh man it was I mean, We we we stayed in a first rate, I guess what you call today a four star hotel but, hell, I don't imagine we paid, twenty dollars, twentyfive dollars a night. You know uh uh, Probably. Probably. But uh, anyhow, uh I I I I my I give my wife the story, Every once in a while this guy\u00ef\u00bds name Cause uh I I I I I like this guy, love him. Uh, and of course, you know I\u00ef\u00bdve never, uh, This one over here on the right, although it\u00ef\u00bds signed by, by n, By, by LeRoy Neiman, Paul, and a uh, And is also signed by the artist, it was done for a, uh, Poster? A benefit, it was a poster. That\u00ef\u00bds just, That\u00ef\u00bds not a, that\u00ef\u00bds not what they call a seriograph, the Joe N, the Joe uh Namath, Who was of course an Alabama football player. Yeah. Yeah. is, I saw it out in San Francisco, and my, my my inlaws bought that for me, uh, but uh, uh, It\u00ef\u00bds a beauty though. That\u00ef\u00bds my, That that\u00ef\u00bds my r, That\u00ef\u00bds my, my experience with one of those machines. I didn\u00ef\u00bdt have enough judgment to, to trade him that fucking machine, To give him the machine. because I\u00ef\u00bdd say probably it wasn\u00ef\u00bdt, Like it was like computers. Well in a year or so after that, that thing was so impractical. Cause it was s, heavy heavy heavy. You, uh and, Well they' it\u00ef\u00bds like you say I Eloise gave me one for Christmas about This big. You know, and you buy one for, sixty dollars. Eighty dollars. I got one, I bought from Radio Shack. It's Well did Rae ever get uh Nierman, No. Never did get it. But she nudged me when she got back, but of course, I guess, I haven\u00ef\u00bdt done it recently, but over the years I like to tell her this story. tonight, because I haven\u00ef\u00bdt thought about it in a long time, And she\u00ef\u00bdll say to me, I told you to get em. I told you. I must've gone into the place five times. You know, I'd go in there, and your mouth is just. Shit. If I buy those But you knew you were gonna have to buy her Well if I had to If I bought those things, Shit I'd have to buy her that damn thing, Oh, ain\u00ef\u00bdt no question. And there was no question about that, there wouldn\u00ef\u00bdt've been Wouldn\u00ef\u00bdt been any living with her. You know, it\u00ef\u00bds uh, y, You know, I I\u00ef\u00bdve gotten a lot better. But in those days, you know, hell I was, uh, maybe, I was, see. Sixtyeight, seventyeight eightyeight, Just twentyseven twentyeight years ago. I was thirtyeight thirtynine years old. And uh, I, I sure didn\u00ef\u00bdt have I sure wasn\u00ef\u00bdt prosperous. I had my damn trip budgeted. And uh, to have gone out there and spent, another fifteenhundred to twothousand dollars for artwork, you know, my mother, who was you know strong as moose meat, come back, if she\u00ef\u00bdd've known, She\u00ef\u00bdd've figured I needed my fucking head examined. She\u00ef\u00bdd've deducted it. Oh. Any rate uh, That\u00ef\u00bds a good story though. Ah it\u00ef\u00bds true story. Good story. True story. It was a true story. I I Well it would've cost you that to replace the doggone machine? Aw I\u00ef\u00bdd've had to replace it for the store, uh, but as I said it was only a matter of, I guess a year, those things were really antiquated. Although we used em a lot. Uh, in those days, and I, you know I recorded the whole trip, and uh, you know things that we did, It was a wonderful trip, Better than keeping a diary? Oh yeah. A lot easier. It really is. Uh, We I keep a Remember we tried keeping a diary on the China trip, and man it was arduous. Well, I keep a course I we we haven\u00ef\u00bdt traveled much lately, I keep a diary, when I, go out of the country. Still got em in here. Otherwise, my problem is, and it\u00ef\u00bds a lot easier to do it that way, but I, I keep I diary when I go out of the country, The problem is, with me, not that it comes up too much, but someone\u00ef\u00bdll say something to me about somewhere I s, Shit, I I, you know I, I forgot where I went. I have to look, cause I can\u00ef\u00bdt remember. Well you go to so many places, on a cruise particularly, Yeah. you know, So many places in a short time, that you get em mixed up. Now we can\u00ef\u00bdt even keep our photos straight without the diary. Oh yeah. Well you know, when you get back from your trip, until you make another trip, you can remember. But, having taken as many trips as you\u00ef\u00bdve taken, shit, they sorta run together. I\u00ef\u00bdm talking about, They do. the ones that were five years ago, Honest they do. to separate the trip that you went on this one It\u00ef\u00bds tough to do. And uh, but, they're a lot that\u00ef\u00bds a lot easier than a diary, then you can transcribe it. But uh, I don\u00ef\u00bdt take, I don\u00ef\u00bdt take my diary in the domestic United States, and we haven\u00ef\u00bdt traveled all that much, but I have taken em, uh, first trip I made, you know, out, In nineteenseventysix. Outside of Mexico, out of the country, was I went to, Uh we went to, I went to the Orient. On a business trip. exploratory trip, fifteen days, worked my ass off. But it was uh, went to uh, Japan, went to Osaka, which was the textile city, and then uh, Taipei and Hong Kong. Uh, and it was a, You\u00ef\u00bdve been. Um but it was for me, uh, uh not only an education, we\u00ef\u00bdd been doing some importing, but uh through, a group. And it was a group of us that went. I guess it probably was, a dozen in our group that went. There was a group of stores that we were associated with, it was a a an interesting trip, uh, very educational. Uh, still got my notes from nineteenseventysix but, and all those god damn cards, you know how they get over there, everybody gives you, gives you, Yeah. gives you a card. I'll never forget how impressed I was with, of all the Orientals, the Japanese are so bright. My god. And uh just uh, uh uh, Catch. They Don\u00ef\u00bdt they. Oh. They really they they really they they really, They work at though man, and the Chinese work at it. They\u00ef\u00bdre good students, You know, Well yeah. well, you know, we see, Listen, look at these people from India. What good students they are. Some of your fine doctors, It\u00ef\u00bds amazing. yeah. You know we see these people, you know You know we\u00ef\u00bdve talked about this, all the problems we got with the Blacks, I was just reading an article, I believe it was the this morning. Where I read it. Maybe it was New York Times yesterday. of the Black juveniles in their twenties, are either in jail, on parole, or just released. Thirtythree percent. And then I, I read in another And that doesn\u00ef\u00bdt count how many got away. Oh that\u00ef\u00bds right. But that\u00ef\u00bds of the in their twenties. I read an article, within the last three or four months, and I\u00ef\u00bdm, I believe I\u00ef\u00bdm correct on this figure that, of the United States MRC is. Twelve percent POUNDING. Of the Black male population. As you say, how many You know, how many oughta be in jail, probably that many more. But the point I was gonna make is, and there\u00ef\u00bdre always exceptions. Uh not to take anything away from uh, Percy Jones. Whose article I read this morning. because I mean he's, I don\u00ef\u00bdt know, what his family had, but I mean he\u00ef\u00bds, you know he\u00ef\u00bds, he\u00ef\u00bds he\u00ef\u00bds he\u00ef\u00bds, come out of it. But, by and large across the board, they\u00ef\u00bdve just never educated themselves. Coming from these backgrounds, Well that\u00ef\u00bds the hard part. and and yet you they haven\u00ef\u00bdt educated themselves. And you see these people come here from POUNDING Taiwan, Korea, Cambodia POUNDING, Taipei, parents can\u00ef\u00bdt speak English, they come over not speaking English, and they, they excel scholastically, in the most difficult subjects. I mean chemistry, physics, medicine. I remember one year, at the time I remember reading the article, it\u00ef\u00bds been ten or twelve years ago, but fourteen, were. Fourteen, uh public and private high schools in ShreveportBos. I remember that, it was a big article, that five valedictorians. For sh_just ShreveportBossier. Five valedictorians that year were of Oriental descent. You know, couldn\u00ef\u00bdt've been at that time, two hundred and fifty families in the whole damn area. No. Uh, You know and you You know um, and you think about the Jews, the Irish, and the Blacks, and it\u00ef\u00bds the same all over the fucking world. Mm. And I just read an article in New York Times. Yesterday. I clipped it. For my wife to read. Uh, about the fact that, in Israel, where they have brought in, thirtythousand, where do the dark ones come from, Ethiopia. Ethiopia. Uh, and fivehundredthousand Russians. very proud of the fact that they\u00ef\u00bdve been able to do this, in a country of five million people. Uh, which, would devastate most countries. I mean they, uh, It\u00ef\u00bds ten percent. the, and and the, the Ethiopians in particular, had a big march last week. Because they\u00ef\u00bdre secondclass citizens. The Jews look down on them too. You know they got a, they got a, they got a, uh, a class situation, they look different, they And Course they haven\u00ef\u00bdt accepted the Russians too well either. Uuh, although the, the the Russians, a high percentage of Russians are, according to this article, uh are scientists, doctors, engineers, mathematicians, and they educated the difficult way. On areas score, score higher on the test than the, than the the nativeborns, but there\u00ef\u00bds a big, you know there\u00ef\u00bds a, there\u00ef\u00bds a, there\u00ef\u00bds a there\u00ef\u00bds a class differential. Which was interesting. I I really, hadn\u00ef\u00bdt thought about it in many years, how those Blacks, uh had integrated into the society. I am told, I haven\u00ef\u00bdt seen any of em, but the Blacks, they\u00ef\u00bdre not like our Blacks. they\u00ef\u00bdre, No no. Small, you know smaller features, but uh, they are dark skinned, and uh, they look different. And uh, I don\u00ef\u00bdt know whether there are any other Black Jews over there, but uh, A lot from South Africa, but they\u00ef\u00bdre welleducated people down there. A lot of em. A lot of Jews from South Afri. Oh yeah. I\u00ef\u00bdm I know that this fellow Goldstone, who was a head of this uh international war crimes tribunal, is a Jewish fellow, because there was a picture of him in the with a yammaka on. Mm. You had to look close, Pretty good indication, Pretty good indication. Well you know, But uh, these These What astounds me is, and this goes back into nineteen, let\u00ef\u00bds see, seventyseven or something, so this, this goes back, oh further than that, maybe nineteenseventy. in in Houston,",
