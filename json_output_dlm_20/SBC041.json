      "hyp_text": "Well, let's kind of figure out a classic diet quota for you. And let me get a piece of paper so that we can write that down. The way we do this is, first of all, we make a guesstimate of how many calories typically that you would need. We didn't do this last time, did we? Okay, all right, yeah, I think we were gonna wait until we, because you were gonna change some things maybe after you saw. So first of all, we make a good guesstimate of how many calories you need, and that's always a tough one. Most women, unless you work out a lot, you probably aren't burning much more than like 1,800 to maybe 2,000 calories. So what we can do, I would say I'm going to go ahead and make it at about 1,800 just because you're at a good weight, you're about 5'5\", I think that would be a prudent place to start out from. I know I won't cause you to gain weight, and you probably won't lose any either. OK, so we're going to take 1,800 calories. How many calories do you think I'm eating now, or can you even tell that from looking? I could do a calorie count on that. Although you wouldn't be able to tell, because I don't write down the fats and things like that. Well, if you gave me real specific amounts, like I had one quarter cup of soy milk, half a cup of cereal, then I could count your calories and figure that out and run it through the computer and get a printout of your nutrient ratio and everything for the day. In fact, if you want to do that, I'd be glad to run it for you, but you'd have to take one day and really be like precise. Okay, so 1,800 calories times 0.4, that's going to be 40 calories, or excuse me, 40% of your calories coming from carbohydrate, and that's the standard protocol really. Okay, times 0.4 gives us 720 carbohydrate calories. Then we divide that by four calories per gram. I know you've seen this before, which gives us a quota of 180 grams of carbohydrate per day. I'm sure she's done that. OK, then we have to distribute it. That's low. That's not that much. It is. Then we have to distribute that into an ideal ratio. Now, you always do have breakfast, really, unless you're running a bit on the higher side. And you always have some kind of lunch, pretty much. And you always have some kind of dinner, basically. Now, the mid-morning snack, the snacks are hit and miss. That's where we maybe would have to look at things a little bit more closely. But usually, lunch and dinner are your main meals. And we would give you about a 30% quota at both lunch and dinner, which is about 54 grams at each of those places. would be sort of your ballpark quota. And it's not outlandish. Like here, you were 64. Well, a little bit higher. Here, well, you were about 40, 59, 64. So 64, 50, that was 74. So it's a little bit higher is what you're used to doing. Yes, I remember like a long, long time ago, let's see, it was I guess 40, maybe 40, 45, 70 or something. That's how they had it divided up. Although that's more, right? Let's see. sounds pretty high yeah that's what a total of a hundred it might have been based either on a higher calorie level or a higher percent of your calories coming from carbose like if this were fifty percent which is probably more realistic for how you eat being a vegetarian you eat more and we can change it up but we'll use this as a base and then we want to compare it to what you Typically do and the thing is if you started doing this right now, you'd have low blood sugars, right? You've already adjusted your insulin to another level. Mm-hmm, but I think what you could learn from this is that At least if you sort of chose a standard. Mm-hmm place for a while until you got things a little more stabilized It might be easier to do your insulin. And then once you are a little more comfortable with that, then you can start doing this flex with adding the unit for another 10 grams. Say if you usually have 64 and you find X units of insulin works for that, well, then you can jockey it from there. Now at breakfast, we often keep that down around 12. because wow uh percent oh i thought you meant grams i was gonna say where do you find food that's that low well some people actually end up having to do that that's only about 22 grams because of that dawn phenomenon So that's not much at all. Like even an English muffin is too much. Even oatmeal. It's really difficult. You can either have either or sort of a thing. Let's see, 60, 72. OK, so that gives us a 28 to distribute throughout the rest of the day. And making a decision of how to do that really involves your insulin. Now, in the morning, you've got a good amount of regular insulin that you take. So I would want to put a little bit higher percentage for your snack there. I would say maybe even 10% here. See, I hate that snack, having to eat snacks. I just don't have time, you know. The only trouble with that is at breakfast you just won't have your insulins there for you. to eat the big carbo breakfast typically, unless you run high after breakfast and then it comes down when the insulins finally do get working. But then you're running high. And that's the only way to protect yourself is, yeah, you eat a bunch of carbo, you take a bunch of insulin, you run high for an hour and a half. And then all of a sudden it comes skyrocketing down when all the insulins get on board. So anyway, 0.1. Okay, that's just going to be 18. Roughly there. How does Liz do that though? Because she like, I don't think she eats lunch or anything. I mean, she just like has this really minimal dose of NPH, I think. That's what I don't know. I don't know the trade secrets there. Probably keeping the carbos a little on the lower side enable, of course, then you need less insulin, which makes life easier. It does make it easier if you do eat less carbo, because you don't have to take these big amounts and then wonder what they're going to do and when. This actually sometimes makes it more complicated. Now mid-afternoon you are taking a touch of regular at lunch but you don't really eat much of a snack usually after lunch because you have a late lunch. You might have some Cheetos there I see. Oh that was just because I was like Couldn't eat dinner. I had to go to something like right at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock or something. So that really may be one where it's sort of debatable. Maybe at the most you'd have 5% there. And I'm just sort of guessing as a place to start. Why did I do that? I knew what it was. And that's just hardly anything. That's a few nuts, really, and that's about it. Then later on, you do sometimes eat after dinner, because you're kind of a night owl. And let's see, this will go 22 plus. So we're looking at about roughly 13%, 15% there. Okay so approximately, well it's essentially like breakfast. So those would just be places to start from. But I think what's even more important is you've got to tailor it to what your insulin is and use these as a jumping off place. If you say, well, this is ridiculous. I always have a 70-carbo dinner. Well, so what? There's nothing wrong with that. It just means, you slightly adjust that insulin. Same thing if you don't like snacks, what are you going to do to compensate for the fact that there's a lot of insulin there maybe? How are you going to get around that? But that's the sole purpose of snacks is to really prevent lows from happening and to counteract the insulin time actions. So maybe we should compare. Go ahead. Oh, I just had one question. So for example, say I didn't eat lunch. Then what would happen? Like, then I could not take the insulin there. And then, well, but then, I don't know. You probably would need to eat a little something because of your NPH peaking, although you don't take a lot of NPH. In the morning, yeah. It may be debatable if you really need to have something to get you into dinner, OK. You know, you might have to eat sort of an afternoon snack if you don't. Or, yeah, look at the MPH that you're taking, and they could help you with that. Did she give you a scale for a no lunch, lunch scale? A while ago, but it changed after that. see this was the original thing that I had she said but okay this was hmm this was a while ago see 324.94 so um like for example she had these two things so if I was going to eat like say I I decided in the morning I was going to eat lunch then I would take four units of nph and then supplement it with the regular but if i knew like say in the morning that i wasn't going to eat lunch then she said take it but this doesn't make any sense to me take six nph because i would be low with this then definitely you know in the afternoon yeah i think this was kind of guessing too because it was before i had really Definitely check with her on your insulins because she is the only one that can really clarify them. It's tough to do the jockeying of the food and the insulin. It just makes it really a challenge there. Well, this is where I got the idea that she probably doesn't eat lunch. Well, I don't know how she would have time anyway. Every time you see her, it's like five minutes here, five minutes there, but then also just like I don't know, she sort of like knew what I meant when I was saying, oh, it's such a pain to have to stop and eat lunch. And so that's where I got that idea. Well, it's, yeah, let's see, so four of n, six of n, and then zero regular there. Yeah, that's we're just monitoring monitoring monitoring Let you know if it's gonna work for you or not if it's too strong or not strong enough Yeah Yeah It's well anyway, how can I how can I help you with all this? I feel like we're still in a pickle and that it's just every day is so different and You're adjusting your insulins per your protocols that you have there. And the carbos are varying around that. But I think it's important we make some kind of a goal to prevent these lows from happening and try and prevent the ones that are creeping up a little bit too high. And you know, what do you think that you could do to clarify this a little bit more and make it a little easier? Well, I guess maybe if I try this, maybe that's the only way. Because it seems like to me that I don't know. Maybe it's easier if I have some kind of set thing. Something to shoot for. Because otherwise I'll just do whatever I feel like doing. Right. Obviously. Well, you could give this a try as far as the levels, but what I would do is use what you're currently doing as sort of a backup guide because obviously if you're having, and this has changed a lot over the past few days, but Well, one day you have 38 at breakfast. The next day you have none. Yeah, but that's like if it's high. 40. And it also, like sometimes I just write them in different columns because depending on what time it was. But if you're having only around, what you can do is sort of round these a little bit. Like shoot for say 25 or just say every morning you're going to have a 30 gram carbohydrate breakfast period. It would work. And then you just start learning from that. You know that a 30 gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement on what you were doing as far as dropping it down a little bit. And yet it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast or bread or English muffins. So you could just lock into that and see how that goes. mid-morning well that's kind of a debatable one because you don't really like to have the snack but try it and see maybe carry something with you and it could be something simple you might make this just sort of a a plastic baggie full of crackers that you take with you wherever you go and just make it a standard habit or it could be a piece of fruit that is going to be approximately in that ballpark and Lunch time, I would say maybe rounding it, I might round it to 60. So what if we increase your quota up to about 45%? It's not a big deal. That's not the most important thing. The main thing is that you're trying to hit those quotas consistently. Here, I don't think you'll have any problem eating something later on after dinner. If anything, it's going to be trying to maybe keep this down around 15 to 30 or something in that ballpark. I agree that if you can make it a little more rock steady, you should be able to smooth some of these things out a bit more if you have a schedule that you're trying to go for. But these are a little bit more scientifically derived based on what insulins are doing and when. Questions. No, I'm just I was just looking at this number and thinking If I only eat that amount of carbohydrate at dinner, I'll be just like dropping You know all night long and and that is so annoying It's like you have to keep eating and keep eating because I've had that happen. Well, maybe realistically what you want to do is keep This one, because lunch, well, what are you gonna have really? You're gonna have, yeah, a couple tortillas or maybe a sandwich or something along that line. Maybe realistically, this is only about 40 or 50-ish. Okay, so that's fine. I would just adjust this to 50 or 45 or whatever you see fit. But dinner, you're right. You have control in that you have a regular sliding scale that you can use and maybe realistically you should make this seventy and just but call it seventy and then really try to stand by that and look at the insulin, look at your numbers before and after and what does happen over the course of the evening. Do you have to go ahead and have this within two hours or or what. But look at it and see, but stand by it, make it like 70 and then just stick to it. OK, so anyway, that's something you could play with for a little while and see if it helps in getting rid of some of the outliers that we're trying to fix up. So other questions?",

      "ref_text": "Well let's kind of figure out a classic, um, diet, uh, quota, for you. And, let me get a piece of, so that we can write that down, The way we do this, Yeah. is first of all, we make a, a guesstimate, of how many calories, typically, that you would need. we didn't do this last time did we. Hmm. Okay. Alright. Yeah, I think we were gonna wait, until we, cause you were gonna change some things maybe, after you saw Doris. So, first of all we make a good guesstimate. Of how many calories you need. And that's always a tough one. Um, Mhm. most women, unless you work out a lot. You probably than like eighteen hundred, to maybe two thousand calories. Mhm. So, what we can do, um, I would say, I'm gonna go ahead and make it out about eighteen hundred. Just because, uh, you're at a good weight, you're about five five, um, I think that would be a prudent place to, to start out from. I know I won't uh, cause you to gain weight, and, you probably won't lose any either. But uh, Okay. So we're gonna take eighteen hundred calories, Uh How um, how many calories do you think I'm eating now, or can you even tell that, from looking? I could do a calorie count, um, on that, but I'd actually need more amounts. Although, you wouldn't be able to tell, because, there's no, I don't write down, like the fats, and things like that. Well, if, if you gave me real specific amounts. Like, I had, you know, one quarter cup of soy milk, half a cup of cereal, Yeah. then I could Oh, I could count your calories, I see. and and figure that out. And run it through the computer. And get a printout. Mm. Hm. Of your nutrient ratio, and everything. Wow. For the day. In fact if you wanna do that, I'd be glad to run it for you, But you'd have to take one day. Mhm. And really, And write everything down. be, Yeah. like, precise. Okay. Um, okay. So eighteen hundred calories, times, point four, that's gonna be forty calories, or excuse me. Um forty percent of your calories, coming from carbo hydrate. And that's Doris's standard protocol really. Mm. Okay times point four, gives us seven hundred and twenty carbohydrate calories. Yeah. Then we divide that by four. Calories per gram. You've I know you've seen this before. Which gives us a quota, of a hundred and eighty grams of carbohydrate per day. Actually I should've done that. Mm. Okay. Then we have to distribute it. Wow. That's low. Yeah. It is. Then we have to distribute that, into a, an ideal ratio. Now you always do have breakfast. Really. Unless you're running, a bit on the higher side. Really high. Yeah. And you always have some kinda lunch pretty much, and you always have some kind of dinner. Well yeah. Basically. Now the midmorning snack, the snacks are hit and miss. That's where, we maybe, would have to, to look at things. A little bit more closely. But usually, lunch and dinner are your main meals. And we would give you about, a thirty percent quota, at both lunch and dinner, which is, about fifty four grams, at each of those places. Hm. Would be sort of your ballpark quota. And, it's not outlandish. Like here you were sixtyfour, well, a little bit higher. Um, Mm. Here, well you were about uh forty fiftynine, sixtyfour. So sixtyfour, fifty, that was seventyfour. So it's a little bit higher. Is what you're used to doing. Mhm. And, um, Yes. Yeah, I remember. Like, a long long time ago. Let's see uh, it was, I guess forty, maybe forty fortyfive seventy. Or something. Okay. That's how they had it divided up. Okay. I think. Although, that's more. Right? Let's see. T_sounds pretty high. That's Yeah. Yeah. That's, what. A total of a hundred and It might've been based, either on a higher calorie level, or, a higher percent, of your calories coming from carbos. Mhm. Mhm. Like if this were fifty percent? Mhm. Which is probably more realistic, for how you eat. Mhm. Being a vegetarian, you eat more And we can change it up. But we'll use this as a base. And then we wanna compare it, Mhm. to what you typically do, and, the thing is if you started doing this right now, you'd have low blood sugars. Cause you've already adjusted your insulin, Right. Yeah. to another level. Mhm. But I think what you could learn from this, is that, um, at least, if you sort of chose a standard place for a while? Mhm. Until you got things a little more stabilized, it might be easier, to do your insulin. Mhm. And then, Mhm. um, once you, are a little more comfortable with that, then you can start doing this flux with, Right. adding the unit for another ten grams. Say if you usually have sixtyfour, and you find, you know, ex units of insulin works for that, Mhm. well, then you jockey it from there. Now at breakfast, we often keep that down around twelve, because, Twelve? Wow. Uh, percent. Uh, Oh, point one two times, I was gonna say, where do you find food, Well, some people actually having to do that. That's only about twentytwo grams. Zero, or something? Because of that dawn phenomenon. Mm. Mm. So, that's not much, at all. Then, Yeah, like even an English muffin is too much. Unhunh. Unhunh. Even oatmeal. It's it's really difficult. you can either have, either or, sort of a thing. Let's see, sixty seventytwo, okay. So that gives us a twentyeight, to distribute throughout the rest of the day. And, um, making a decision of how to do that, really involves your insulins. Now, in the morning, you've got a good amount. Of regular insulin that you take? Mhm. So I would wanna put a little bit higher percentage, for your snack there? Like, Mhm. I would say maybe even ten percent here? Um, See, I hate that snack. Having to eat snacks. Oh. I just don't have time. You know. The only trouble with that is, at breakfast, you, your insulins there for you, to eat the big carbo breakfast, typically. Mm. Unless, you run high, after breakfast. And then it comes down, when the insulins finally do get working. But then you're running high. Mhm. Mhm. And that's, you know, that's the only way to protect yourself, Right. is yeah, you eat a bunch of carbo, you take a bunch of insulin, you run high for an hour and a half, Right. and then all of a sudden it comes skyrocketing down. Mhm. When all the insulins get on board. Mhm. So, um, Right. Anyway. Uh, point one, okay, that's just gonna be eighteen, I wonder how roughly there, How does Doris do that though. Because she like, I don't think she eats lunch, or anything. I mean, she just like, has this really minimal dose of NPH, I think. You'd have to ask her. That's what uh, That's what I suspect. I don't know. I don't know the. Um, but uh, you know I think, probably, um, keeping the carbos a little on the lower side, enable Of course then you'd need less insulin, which makes life easier. Mhm. Mhm. It does make it easier, if you do eat less carbo. Cause you don't have to take these big amounts, and then wonder what they're gonna do and when. Mhm. Um, this actually, sometimes makes it more complicated. Now, mid afternoon. you are taking a touch of regular at lunch, but you don't really eat much of a snack. Usually. After lunch. Cause you have a late lunch, might have some Cheetos there I see. Mhm. Oh, that was just cause I was like, Um, couldn't eat dinner. Cashews. Hm. Um, I had to go to something, like right at, at six o'clock, or seven o'clock, or something. So that really may be one, where, it's sort of debatable. You know, maybe at the most you'd have five percent there. Um, and I'm just sort of guessing, as a place to start, uh why'd I do that? I knew what it was? And that's just hardly anything. That's a Some, a few nuts. Really. And that's about it or, um, then later on, you do sometimes eat after dinner. Cause you're kind of a nightowl, and um, let's see this'll go twentytwo, plus, uh, so we're looking at, about, roughly, thirteen fifteen percent there, so, okay so, approximately well s, essentially like breakfast. So, those would just be places to start from. PAPER_TEAR But I think, um, what's even more important, Okay. is, you've gotta tailor it, to what your insulin is. And use these as a jumping off place. You know, if you say, well this is ridiculous, I always have a seventy carbo dinner, Mhm. well, so what. You know, there's nothing wrong with that, it just means, you slightly adjust that insulin. Same thing if you don't like snacks, what are you gonna do to compensate, Mhm. for the fact, that, there's there's a lotta insulin there maybe. And um, Mhm. how are you gonna get around that. Um, but that's the sole purpose of snacks, is to really prevent, lows from happening, and to counteract, um, the insulin time actions. Um, So. Hm. Oh Maybe we should Go ahead. Oh, I just had one question, so for example, Unhunh? say I didn't eat lunch? Then what would happen. Like, then I could not take the insulin there. And then, Well, But then, I don't know, you probably would need to eat a little something, I wonder. I would get high then maybe, hunh? because, of your NPH peaking, Mhm. Mhm. although, you don't take a lot of NPH. So, In the morning yeah. It may be debatable, if you really need to have something, later in the af, uh or, to get you into dinner, okay. Um, Hmm. You know, you might have to eat sort of an afternoon snack, if you don't. Mhm. Um, or, yeah. Take, look at, look at the NPH that you're taking, and, Doris could help you with that. Did she give you a scale for a no lunch, lunch scale. A while ago, but um, it changed after that. See this was the original thing. That I had. She said, but Okay, this was, hm. This was a while ago. See, three twentyfour ninetyfour. So, um, like, for example, she had these two things, so if I was gonna eat, like say I, I decided ok, in the morning. I was gonna eat lunch? Then, I would take four, units of NPH and then, supplement it, with the regular, but if I knew, like say in the morning? That I wasn't gonna eat lunch? Then, Hm. she said take But this doesn't make any sense. To me. Take six NPH, cause I would be low, with this then, definitely. You know. Yeah, In in the afternoon. hunh. Okay. Yeah. I think this was kinda guessing, Well, too. Cause, it was before, Hm. I had really Yeah. Definitely, um, you know, check with her, on your insulins. Cause, you know, she, is the only one that can really clarify them. Um, you know, just, it's tough. To, to do the jockeying of of the food, and the insulin. It really, um, Mm. It it just, it makes it really, um, a a challenge there to, Well, this is where I got the idea that she Probably doesn't eat lunch. Well, I don't know how she would have time, anyway. Every time you see her, it's like, you know five minutes here, five minutes there, but um, then, also, just like um, I don't know. She sort of, like, knew what I meant, when I was saying, Unhunh. Unhunh. oh, it's such a pain to have to stop and eat lunch. Mhm. You know. And, so, um, that's where I got that idea. But, Mm. Mhm. Well, it's, Yeah. Let's see. And so four of N, six of N, and then zero regular there. Yeah. Hm. That's where just monitoring, monitoring, monitoring. Mhm. Um, lets you know, if if it's gonna work for you, or not. If it's too strong, or, not strong enough. Mhm. Um, yeah. Yeah. Right. So it's, Well anyway, how can I How can I help you. I feel like uh, we're still in a pickle, in that um, it's just, every day, is so different, and, you know you're you're adjusting your insulins, Right. uh, per your, uh, protocols that you have there, and the carbos are varying around that, um, but, you know, I think it's important we, make some kind of a a goal, to prevent these lows from happening, Mhm. and uh, try and prevent the ones that are creeping up a little bit too high. And, you know, what do you think, um, that uh you could do, to more and, Oh, make it a little easier. Well, I guess maybe if I try this. maybe that's the only way. Cause it seems like to me that um, I don't know. It's Maybe it's easier, if I have like some kind of set thing, cause then, Yeah. Something to shoot for. Yeah. Kinda, Cause otherwise, I'll just do whatever I feel like doing, Right. you know. Right. Uh, Obviously. Well, you you could give this a try, as far as the levels, but what I would do, is, is use, what you're currently doing as sort of a backup guide. Because, obviously, if you're having, and and this has changed. A lot. Uh over the past few days. But um, well one day you have thirtyeight at breakfast. The next day you have none. Um, Yeah but that's like if it's high. Forty, And it also, like sometimes I just write em in different columns. Cause, Okay. Cause uh, depending on what time it was. But, if you're having only, you know. Around, and what you could do is sort of round these. A little bit. Like shoot for say twentyfive, or, Mhm. just say every morning, you're gonna have a thirty, Mhm. like a thirty gram carbohydrate brekfast. Period. Mhm. That's um, it it would work. And then you just start learning from that. Mhm. You know, you know that a thirty gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement, on what you were doing, as far as, dropping it down a little bit, Mhm. Mhm. and yet, it would be, it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast, or bread, Right. or English muffins, Right. so you could just lock into that. And uh, see see how that goes. Um, uh, mid morning, well, that's kind of a debatable one, cause you don't really like to have the snack, Mhm. but, try it. And see. Maybe carry something with you. And it could be something simple. You might make this just sort of a, a plastic baggie full of crackers. That you take with you wherever you go, Mhm. Right. and just make it a standard habit. Mhm. Or, it could be a piece of fruit. That is gonna be approximately in that ballpark. And, lunchtime? I I would say maybe rounding it, I might round it to sixty. So, so what if we increase your quota up to about fortyfive percent. Mhm. It's not a big deal. That that's not the most important thing. The main thing is that you're trying to hit those quotas consistently. Mhm. Um, here, I don't think you'll have any problem eating something later on after dinner, if anything it's, it's gonna be, trying to maybe keep this down. Mhm. Around fifteen to thirty, or something in that ballpark. Mhm. But, I agree, that if you can make it a little more rock steady, you should be able to smooth some of these things out a bit more, if you have a schedule that you're trying, Mhm. to to go for. But these are a little bit more scientifically derived, Yeah. Mhm. Mhm. based on, what insulins are doing, and when. Right. So, Yeah. Hm. Questions. Uh, No, I'm just, I was just looking at this number, and thinking, if I only eat that, amount of carbohydrate at dinner, I'll be just like dropping. You know. With your All night long. And and, that is so annoying. It's like you have to keep eating, and keep eating. Cause I've had that happen. Well, maybe realistically what you wanna do, is keep this one, because lunch, well what are you gonna have really. You're gonna have, yeah. A couple tortillas, or maybe a sandwich, or something along that line. Yeah. Maybe realistically, this is only about, forty, or fiftyish. Yeah. Okay. So that's fine. I would just adjust this, to, fifty, or fortyfive, or whatever you see fit. Mhm. But dinner, you're right. You have control, in that you have a regular sliding scale, that you can use, and, maybe b, realistically you should make this seventy. Mhm. Mhm. And just, but, but call it seventy, and then really try to stand by that. And look at the insulin, look at your numbers before and after, and what does happen over the course of the evening. Um, do you have to go ahead and have this within two hours? Or, Mhm. uh, or what. Mhm. But but look at it and see, but stand by it. Make it like seventy, and then just stick to it. Mhm. Um, Okay. So, Okay. So, anyway. That's something you could play with for uh a little while, and see if if it um helps, in getting rid of some of the outliers. That we're trying to fix up. So, um, other questions. Uh,",
