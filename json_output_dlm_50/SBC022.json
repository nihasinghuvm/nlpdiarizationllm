      "hyp_text": "You know, it was really pretty straightforward this morning. And I thought you did a good job all the way through. I mean, you were on top of it. You were scanning. Should have kept that one horizon forward, Jeff, just to keep him on the right. Why did you switch him? Well, looking at something, it didn't seem like I could get someone else out to provide a good service. Well, I guess that's one reason that 2-8's kinda... 2-8's kinda nice sometimes because on 1-10 all the departures seem like they're going off to the left, so you really want your arrivals on the right. When you land a 2-8, you can get departures off almost both at any time, so you almost got a hole. But don't feel bad about keeping a horizon on the right for it because it sure doesn't hurt them to taxi and they're so used to having a number one service. Yeah, that's when they're departing. Everyone wanted their bike. Even one or two of them said, I'll advise if the left becomes available. They said, we'd like the left if it becomes available. I know, they still ask. And Viking is the same way. So there's sure nothing wrong with keeping them on the right, though. Travis Guache, we discussed. So radar service for me, call me inbound. You want to say rate of service terminated, frequency change report back inbound. I think that's something a little more like that's better than just saying rate of service terminated because he's kind of... And you can just say rate of service terminated, report back inbound, and then he'll either come back and say, oh I'm departing the area, not back to Hillsboro, or I'll call you back inbound. So that gives you an idea. And along with that, Let TC do more of the work for you. Just tell her what you wanted to do. I was thinking of a couple of instances where you could have used her more than you did. I was thinking it for my rundowns. That would have been a help, but on the other hand, Oh, thank you very much. Did you hear that? The problem with doing rundowns is that it's kind of over in your face. Yeah. Yeah. So the D light's kind of pretty far over to the left there. You can ever do it if you want. I'm just working at doing as much of these other things as I possibly can. because there'll be times when I won't have a TC and just challenging myself. What were some of the things that I should have used before that I didn't use? Depending on who your TC is, if certain people sit down there, they have a tendency to do everything for it. And sometimes that is really pretty nice. All you have to do is stand up and look out the window and look at the bright and talk. no other coordination or arts functions or anything, that really is nice. It really helps the situation. So, but right now, like you say, maybe it is better for you to do some of that stuff. I don't think there was, I mean I had just a couple that I switched to the left, you know, maybe three or so that I switched to the left, probably two or three, until there was that. I didn't have any arts entries. I had traffic watch to slew out to for the most part I mean I was able to I think I was able to keep up with that stuff with the arts yeah I mean there was really nothing much to do so but there could be yeah there's VFRs to party yeah I told it to do my VFR guys and right now my VFR is something I gotta kick myself to do Now we're still required to write like the empires that come in through the gates of VFR, don't they? We are. Any VFR. No, isn't that, aren't they when they, but what if they've, well I guess we have no way of knowing if they've come to IFR and then canceled VFR. Well yeah, because they have a strip on it downstairs, so I don't, actually, I'm like you, I don't really know what the point is of that, because we do have a record of them anyway, but when the, order came across or whatever it is, a memorandum that said to write down all VFR rivals. So if they're a VFR rival, you're supposed to write it down. When Horizon 138 didn't ask you there? Go back to ground? Or did we run into something else? I mean, you tried him a couple times, you say Horizon 138, pull him down out of here. They don't get the hint if he's... But if you can't get him, Just go on and do something else that you can do. Uniter was calling ready to go. So shoot, just let Uniter go. Horizon, you can't do nothing with him, so just have him hold there. So just go on to the next. Next thing, and do tell ground. He might be still in ground frequency, which is usually not too likely because At that point he was out there and he's probably sitting there and he's not hearing anything from the tower. You know he's probably looking at his radio about then. Yeah, I think I was a little bit rigid in my planning of that because I wanted to have a plan to get him out at that point and should have been more flexible. Everything else I saw your separation was was really good this morning. I mean you really tightened him up Maybe a couple times almost a little bit too tight because a Couple times you had like one just barely departure in a jet at the parts when you clear another jet for takeoff And it worked out great. Oh, we got the retina Oh that both guys have the less guys off the left and worked out good, but I think it worked out because I This guy was real slow on starting his departure roll. You know, usually you gotta get him just a little bit off the departure end before you clear the next guy. And watch out for the 737-400s, the 300s, because they'll really climb and they can go fast too. Just take into consideration the type of aircraft. It takes a 727 a little while to get wound up with a 737. But I mean, it was really good. Good departure separation. Thanks. I was impressed. And you saw a little bit about the 260 heading. I listened to the readbacks for him. Yeah. Because I know he said 230. But you can wrap him around to 130 or 160 to avoid the MVA. And that looks great, because otherwise you've got 260. There was that one time you had two South Plan aircraft and one I actually didn't think you were going to have three miles between the two first southbound area, but you did. That was perfect. And that was good. It was real good planning to keep that one caravan on runway heading when you had the other one going 260. to ensure that you had the one going 240 or something. And then you had the metro going 260. You kept the metro on this runway heading, which is really good planning. So I'm less and less impacted, for lack of a better word, For some reason with all these, I think the bulk of my planning seems to evolve around these little guys when I can turn them, fitting in with all my other guys. For some reason, I mean, and that is, you know, those guys having a very effective part in the whole fan of all our departures. And I think they're affecting me less than they did in the past. Does that make sense? Because there was a time where, I mean that sequence was good too, but there was a time when it may happen again. I've got these little west coasts in here and all these guys off the right. Where am I actually going to fit these guys in? And they're all calling ready way early. Well the sequence can't be too bad when you can feed from Charlie and from Bravo and from Alpha. You know, the sequence can't be too bad. I mean, all he did. He had something you can do. Yeah. All he did was send them all out. I mean, you got all the West Coast in the row over on Charlie. You got the Jets in a row on Bravo. And you got various things over here. So you can pick and choose. I mean, as a ground control, you can just send them all out there. And then when they get there, then you can start arranging the strips. You know, the way you want. Almost. Yeah. It works great. Because you don't have to sequence them at some other point in their taxi route. Yeah. They're essentially on their own taxiway up to the approach room. So that was about all that I had. I mean, I was paying pretty close attention there, and I didn't really see much of a problem, any significant problems to talk about. Oh, don't always, don't insist on always saying 700. If you say... At some point after he is leaving 700, just wait until he is leaving 700. Sometimes you can hit it. There was a couple times you didn't need to say it when you did. He either waited just a bit. If he was out 500 climbing, just go ahead and say turn left heading 160. I was watching Jet Speed come in. You got Delta out in front of Jet Speed. It seemed like you were a little tense with that. really pay attention to the speeds when they come in. He was doing 120 outside of Laker there. Did you see that? Yeah. So that worked out great. Yeah. I mean there was lots of room. Lots of time. He wasn't flying as a normal. For some reason he's usually, or is it, exec jet? One of those guys is usually really fast. Jet's too, I know, fast on departure it seems. Yeah. I think it seemed like that was the one. Yeah, and flight when they fly the other jet. Yeah, I think I might have said for Delta Manager to no delay or something like that. Yeah, I think he did. He was actually floating at the jet speed, wasn't he? Yeah, he had a lot of time. When the twins get airborne, you got a jet falling, the twins gonna go southwestbound? If you got 6,000 feet and the twins climbing out of four or five hundred, you can start your transmission then to the to the jet. Twin Cessna heads will be turning south westbound momentarily. Runway 28 leftover takeoff. This is in sight. Just to make sure he gets his turn in. The caravan's coming across. If you want to get... Yeah, what do you say? Because I've heard different phraseology and I feel like I was stumbling over that. I think I said it a couple different ways. A mile west or something. I just say, you know, on a day like this it's so easy to see him. I would just say the caravan ahead is southwestbound, runway 2 at leftover takeoff. And a lot of times they'll say out in sight. If they don't say in sight, they'll say, ugh. I would assume they have them inside because they won't go unless they see them. I mean, that's important to them to see the traffic. But it's safe. It's a safe operation. Because one thing you could do is turn the caravan to 240. You get him across, and then you support your ship and send him back to 250 or something like that. Because the tracks wasn't what's important. But 250 was working out fine today. 15 degrees in a mile is what you need. Or less, using visual. Yeah, I think it was the West Coast that was the horizon. He said he could do the visual with the twin sus, and they had always a vice versa on one of the two. And at that point, I said, don't need it now. I got it. Somebody in there? I think Laura went in there. I'm flying for you. OK.",

      "ref_text": "You know it's, it was really pretty straightforward this morning. And, I thought you did a good job all the way through. I mean you were on top of what you were scanning, Hm. Thanks. um, should've kept that one Horizon, Fauker jet. just keep em on the right. Why did you switch em. Well, looking at something, I would get it didn't seem like I could get someone else out. But, um, and, part of it to provide a good service, but then, Yeah. Well, I guess that's one reason the two eight's kind of well, two eight's kinda nice sometimes, because, I mean when we're on ten, all the departures seemed like they're going out the left. so you really want your arrivals on the right. When you're landing two eight, then you can get departures off of, almost both at any time. So you always got a hole. N_yeah. Yeah. So, but uh, don't feel bad about keeping Horizon on the right, because, Mhm. sure doesn't hurt them to taxi. They're so used to having, A number one service, Yeah. plus when they're departing, g every one of em came they're right by the gate. even, even one one or two of em I said, I'll advise if the left becomes available. and they said w, and they they still ask. we'd like the left, if it. I know, they still ask. And Viking is the same way. Yeah. So. There's sh there's sure nothing wrong with keeping em on the right though. Um, Traffic Watch Eight we discussed, So radar service terminated, um, call me inbound, or, You wanna say radar service terminated, frequency change approved. Report back inbound. Or, I I think that something a little 0ttle more like that's better, than just saying radar service terminated, because, he's kinda Left hanging. Okay. And you could just say, radar service terminated, report back inbound, and then he'll he'll either come back and say, well I'm departing the area, now back to Hillsborrow, Or I'll call you back inbound. So that gives you an idea. Okay. But uh, and uh, Along with that, Let TC, do more of the work for you. Okay. you know, Um, just tell her what you want her to do. I was thinking of a couple instances, where you could've used her more than you did. Okay. I was thinking that for my rundowns, you know that would, that's that would have been a help, but, on the other the other hand, I wanna get it on tape, heck of a job Lance. Oh thank you very much. Did you hear that? um, The problem with doing rundowns, is that it's kind of over in your face. Yeah Yeah. So, Cause the Dlight's kind of, pretty far over to the left there, but you can, you can have her do it if you want. Um, I would I'm just working at, doing as much of these other things as I possibly can, Because they'll be times when I won't have a TC, and just just challenging myself. And that's okay. Um, what were some of the things, other than what were some of the things that, that I should have used her for that I didn't. Depending on who your Who your TC is, if certain people sit down there, they they have a tendency to do everything for you. And sometimes that is that is really pretty nice. If you just, if you just, all you have to do is stand up, and look out the window, and look at the bright. and talk. no other no other coordination, or, or ARTS functions, or anything, That really is nice. That's ideal. It it really helps. Mhm. the situation. Mhm. So, but, Right now, like you say, maybe it is better for you to do some of that stuff. um, I don't think there was, I mean I had, just a couple that I switched to the left, you know maybe three or so, that I switched to the left, uh uh probably two or three, and so there was that, I didn't have any ARTS entries, I had, you know, Traffic Watch to slue out to, um, For the most part, I mean I was able to I think I was able to keep up with that stuff, With the ARTS. Yeah. I mean, there wasn't really nothing much to do. No, um, there wasn't. So, But there could be. Yeah. If there's VFRs departing, or, Yeah. I told her to do my VFR guys. 0h Yeah. And um, to write down my VFRs. That's one thing I gotta kick myself to do. Yeah. Now are we still required to write, like, the Empires that coming in through the gates VFR? Don't they? We are? Any VFR. Now isn't that, aren't they when they But what if they've well I guess we have no way of knowing if they've come in IFR, and then cancelled VFR. Well yeah, because they have a strip on it downstairs. Mhm. So. I don't actually, I'm like you, I don't really know what the point is of that. Because we do have a record of em anyway. Mhm. But, when the when the order came across or whatever, memorandum that said, to write down all VFR arrivals. Okay. So, if they're a VFR arrival, you're supposed to write it down. Okay. Unhunh. When Horizon onethirtyeight didn't answer you there? Go back to ground? Yeah. or just move on to something else. I mean you tried him a couple times. You say Horizon onethirtyeight, XXXX, if they don't get the hint, if he's but if you can't get him, just go on. and do something else that you can do. United was calling ready to go. Yeah. So, shoot. just let United go. Horizon, Yeah, you can't do nothing with him, so just have him hold there. So just go on to the next. Okay. Next thing, and do tell ground. He might be still on ground frequency, which is uh, usually not too likely, because, you know, At that point. At that point, well he's out there, you know, and he's probably sitting there, He's and he's not hearing anything, from the tower you know, Yeah, he's probably, looking at his radio about then, Yeah, I think I was a little bit rigid in my planning of that, cause I wanted to had to plan, to get him out at that point. and, I should've been more flexible and, But uh, you know, everything else I saw, your separation was, was really good this morning. I mean you really tightened em up. Maybe a couple times almost a little bit too tight. Cause uh, I don't know, a couple times you had, like one just barely at departure end, a jet at departure, and you cleared another jet for takeoff. And it worked out great. Oh. One guy out the right and then oh both guys out the left. Both guys out to the left. And it worked out good, but, I think it worked out because, this guy, was real slow, on on starting his departure roll. You know, Mhm. usually you gotta get em just a little bit off the departure end. before you clear the next guy. And watch out for the uh, the seventhirtyseven, fourhundreds, Fourhundreds, Okay. Or threehundreds and, Okay. Because uh, they'll really climb. And they can go fast, too. Okay. So, well you know, just take into consideration the type of aircrafts. It takes the seventwentyseven a little while to get wound up, while the seventhirtyseven'll really go. But uh, I mean it was really good. Good departure separation. Thanks. I was impressed. And, you saw, a little bit about the twosixty? Heading? Listen to the readbacks for Yeah. If I know he's at twothirty. But you can wrap em around, to onethirty or onesixty, to avoid the MBA, and that works great, because, otherwise you got twosixty? There was that one time you had two south plan aircraft, and one or, metro and, Mhm. Mhm. I I actually didn't think, you were gonna have three miles between the two first, Mhm. south, but you did. That was perfect. The one that I kept on runway heading for a bit? Yeah. or, Yeah. Okay. And that was good, it was real good planning, to keep that one Caravan on runway heading, when you had the other one going twosixty? To ensure that you had, oh and you had the one going twoforty. or something, and then you had the Metro going s going twosixty. Yeah. But you kept the Metro on, runway heading. Which is really good planning. So, I'm I'm less and less impacted. For lack of a better word. by, these for some reason, with all these, um, I think, the bulk of my planning, seems to revolve around these little guys, when I can turn em, fitting em in with all my other guys, for some reason, I mean y, and that is, you know, those guys, having a very affective part, in the whole fan, of all our departures. And um, Hm. I think they're, they're affecting me less than they did in the past. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah. Um, cause there was a time where, I mean that sequence was good too. but there was a time when, yeah an it it may happen again. Yeah. where I've got, the little West Coasts in here, and all these guys off the right and left, where am I actually gonna fit these guys in, and they're all calling, they're ready way early. And, Well the sequence, uh, can't be too bad. When you got when you can feed from charley, and from bravo, and from alpha. You know, the sequence can't be too bad, I mean all he did, You got something you can do. Yeah. All he did is send em all out. I mean you got all the West Coasts in the row over on charley, you got the jets in a row on bravo, and you got various things over here. So, you can pick and choose. You know, I mean as a ground control, you can just send em all out there, and then, when they get there, then you can start arranging the strips. You know, the way you want, almost. Yeah. You know th, that's, Yeah. that, it works great. Because you don't have to sequence em at some other point, That way. in their taxi route, you know, Yeah. They're they 0. 000000e00 essentially on their own taxiway, up through up to the approach end. So, that I you know, that I had. I mean, I was paying pretty close attention there, and I didn't really see much of a problem. Oh. Thanks. No significant problems. to talk about. I'm glad. See there was, Oh um, don't always, um, don't insist on always saying, seven hundred. If you say Why hadn't you Oh, at some point after he is leaving seven, just wait till he is leaving seven hundred you mean? Sometimes you can do that. Yeah. Yeah. There was a couple times, you didn't need to say it when, when you did. It was out in the yeah. Yeah. Well I mean Could've either waited just a bit, it was at He was at a fivehundred climb and, Or, he was just go ahead and say, turn left heading one six zero. Okay. Or turn left heading two six zero. For a Metro. I mean if you leave em on runway heading, for a little bit, Mhm. they're gonna be at the altitude you need so, but that's no big deal. And uh, I was watching Jet Speed come in, and you got Delta out in front of Jet Speed. Mhm. It seemed like you were a little tense with that but, really pay attention to the speeds when they're coming in. He was doing a hundred and twenty outside of Laker there. Did you see that? Yeah. Yeah. So that that worked out great. I wondered if you'd Yeah. I mean there was lots of room. Lots of time. Mhm. He wasn't, he wasn't flying as a normal, Mhm. For some reason, he just used the Mhm. Or is it uh, Exec Jet. One of those guys is usually really fast. Jet Speed is I know fast on the departure, AMFlight. it seems. Yeah. I think. It seems like that was the one, but, yeah AMFlight, when they fly the later jet. Um, yeah. And I think I might have said for delta niners or to, no delay, or something like that and, Yeah. I think you did. And he was actually floating at the Jet Speed wasn't yeah. Yeah, you had a lot of time. Yeah. When the Twins get airborne, you got a jet, the twin's gonna go southwestbound? If you got sixthousand feet, and the twin's climbing out of four or five hundred, you can start your transmission, then to the, to the jet. Okay. Twin Cesna ahead is, will be turning southwestbound, momentarily, runway two eight left clear for takeoff. It says in sight, Just sure he gets his turn in? Mhm. Okay. The Caravan's coming across, if you wanna get Yeah what do you say. Cause I've heard different phraseology, and I feel like I was stumbling over that, I think I said it, couple different ways. A mile west, or something I'I just say, you know on a day like this, it's so easy to see em, I would just say the Caravan ahead, is southwestbound. Runway two eight left, clear for takeoff. And and they'll, a lot of times they'll say uh in sight. If they don't say in sight, they'll say, they'll, I would assume they have em in sight, because they won't go. Mhm. Unless they seem em. I mean that's important to them, to see the traffic. but it's safe, it's a safe operation. Because, 0ne thing, you could do, is is turn the Caravan to twoforty. Mhm. To get him across. And then, just before you ship em, send em back to twofifty something like that. Hm. Cause the track's what what's important. But, but twofifty was working out fine today. Fifteen degrees and a mile. Is what you need so, or less. using visual. Yeah, In fact it was a, Was the West Coast that was it the Horizon who said he could do the visual with the Twin Cesna ahead, or was it vice versa, one of the two. Yeah. And at that point I said, don't need it now. They got it. Somebody in there? I think Laura went in there, yeah. Comm, line for you. have a call on the other line. This is Randy. Okay. M_bye.",
